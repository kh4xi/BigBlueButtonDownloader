# BigBlueButtonDownloader

## Installing dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

BigBlueButton stores the voice and the screen record as separate, so this script automatically downloads both files then merges as one. 
So your link should be like

`https://example.com/playback/presentation/2.3/a23fde4e678081212412`


### Run
`python bluebutton.py`
